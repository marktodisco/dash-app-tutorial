# Dash App Tutorial

## Introduction

This project is organized into two main parts, *before* and *after*. *After* is a refactored version of the app. However, since we plan to do a tutorial, rather than a refactoring or code roast video series, the code in *before* is an un-refactored version of the app. We prefer the *before* code because it should be easier for the YouTube channel's audience to understand.

## Running the *before* version

Run the following commands and open the local host web address chosen by Dash.

```shell
cd ./before
python ./main.py
```

An example of the expected terminal messages are shown below:

```shell
Dash is running on http://127.0.0.1:8050/
